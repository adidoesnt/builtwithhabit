					we truly believe strength training is one of the most powerful tools for women of all ages
					to build confidence, longevity, and resilience.
				</p>
				<p class="font-body text-dark-brown text-2xl">
					our approach blends science-backed training, whole-food nutrition, and mindful living.
					with a background in life sciences, iâ€™m personally passionate about cutting through
					misinformation and using evidence-based practices to create personalised, sustainable
					fitness plans. at builtwithhabit, we believe that food should be both nourishing and
					enjoyable, and we love helping clients discover high-protein, nutrient-dense meals that
					fuel their goals without restriction.
				</p>
				<p class="font-body text-dark-brown text-2xl">
					most importantly, we work closely with each client to understand what feels right for
					their body. this enables us to create tailored programs that empower you to feel strong,
					healthy, and capable - at any stage of life.
